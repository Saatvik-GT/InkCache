## Overview

InkCache is a distributed caching system built as part of the **Chandigarh University Season of Code (CUSoC)** program under subject code **24CSI-305 (Institute/Industrial Summer Training)**.

Traditional caching layers (Redis, Memcached) rely on static eviction policies — LRU, LFU, or fixed TTLs — that don't adapt to changing access patterns. InkCache aims to layer _intelligence_ on top of a solid distributed caching foundation: predicting hot keys, adapting eviction dynamically, and rebalancing load across nodes without manual tuning.

## Problem Statement

Modern applications serve highly skewed, time-varying access patterns (diurnal traffic, sudden hotspots, seasonal spikes) that static caching policies handle poorly — leading to unnecessary cache misses, wasted memory on cold keys, and uneven load across distributed nodes.

InkCache addresses this by combining:

1. A **correct, performant distributed cache core** (replication, consistent hashing, failure handling)
2. An **adaptive intelligence layer** that learns access patterns and adjusts eviction/prefetching decisions accordingly

## Current Status

**Implemented and working today (single-node demo):**

- In-memory cache core: get/set/delete, TTL with lazy expiry + background sweep, configurable eviction — `access-aware` (default: samples the least-recently-used keys and evicts whichever was read the fewest times, a window-LFU-style heuristic) or strict `lru`; expired entries are always reclaimed before live ones either way
- REST API (Express): `/set`, `/get/:key`, `/delete/:key`, `/keys`, `/keys/stats`, `/flush`, `/metrics`, `/health`, `/version`, with real per-op latency instrumentation (avg/p95), hit-rate and rolling throughput, JSON error responses (400/404) instead of Express's default HTML pages, and graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Neumorphic dashboard (React + Vite + Tailwind + react-router-dom), two routes:
  - `/` — a home page with a real Three.js hero (a ring of glass cache-slot cubes orbiting a pulsing core, driven live by real hit-rate/ops-per-second — not decoration), a live stats strip, feature cards, a quick-start snippet, and an honest architecture note
  - `/dashboard` — the console: keyboard-driven KV console (`set k v [ttl]`, `get k`, `del k`, `flush`) with a pressable send button, circular hit-rate gauge + hand-built analog needle gauge for ops/s + real ops/s/hit-rate/p95-latency sparklines, KEYS panel rendered as an access-frequency heat map (colored by real hit count from `/keys/stats`), color-coded hit/miss/evict op stream with a punch-card/dot-matrix restyle, optional synthesized sound cues per event kind (Web Audio, off by default), node online/offline status pill, synthetic traffic simulator (fires real requests), power-on boot sequence
  - Both routes respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; the 3D scene is lazy-loaded (code-split so `/dashboard` never downloads three.js) and falls back to a static panel if WebGL isn't available or the scene fails at runtime
- Unit + API tests (`npm test`) and a GitHub Actions CI workflow running them on every push/PR

**Not yet implemented (roadmap):** multi-node replication, consistent hashing, failover, and the benchmarking suite. The "adaptive intelligence layer" in the architecture diagram below is still aspirational as a learned/trained model — what exists today is the access-aware eviction heuristic above, which is real engineering (bounded-window frequency scoring) but not machine learning. Nothing in the dashboard is mocked — every number comes from the running node.

## Key Features

- **Core Cache Engine** — configurable eviction (access-aware frequency/recency hybrid, or strict LRU), TTL support, single-threaded so there's no locking to get wrong
- **Distributed Architecture** — consistent hashing for key distribution across nodes
- **Replication & Fault Tolerance** — primary-replica model with automatic failover
- **Adaptive Intelligence** — access-pattern-based eviction and predictive prefetching
- **Metrics Dashboard** — real-time hit rate, latency, and node health visualization
- **Benchmarking Suite** — performance comparison against baseline Redis/Memcached setups

## Project Roadmap

Development follows CUSoC's bi-weekly sprint cadence across three quarters.

### Quarter I — Engineering Foundation

- [x] Sprint 1: Single-node cache core (TTL, web console + API) — _LFU-as-a-standalone-policy still pending, superseded in practice by the access-aware hybrid below_
- [ ] Sprint 2: Benchmarking baseline, cache invalidation strategies, basic metrics logging

### Quarter II — Product Engineering

- [ ] Sprint 3: Multi-node replication (primary-replica model)
- [ ] Sprint 4: Consistent hashing, node discovery, failure handling
- [x] Sprint 5 (partial): Access-pattern-aware eviction — bounded-window frequency scoring on top of recency (`INKCACHE_EVICTION_POLICY=access-aware`, see [docs/api.md](docs/api.md#eviction-policy)). Predictive prefetching and a trained/learned model are still open.

### Quarter III — Production & Leadership

- [ ] Sprint 6: Metrics dashboard ✔ (single-node version done early), load testing, benchmarking vs. Redis/Memcached
- [ ] Sprint 7: Deployment, final documentation, demo preparation

> Full milestone tracking is maintained via GitHub Issues and Milestones.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20.4 (the test suite uses `node:test`'s Date-mocking timers, which need 20.4+)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional — only needed for the [Dockerfile](#deployment)-based deploy path, not for local dev)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Saatvik-GT/InkCache.git
cd InkCache

# Install dependencies (node + dashboard)
npm install
npm install --prefix src/dashboard

# Run cache node + dashboard together
npm run dev
```

The cache node listens on `http://localhost:8080`; the dashboard is served
at `http://localhost:5173` (`/` is the home page, `/dashboard` is the live
console) and reaches the node through the `/api` dev proxy.
To run them separately: `npm run dev:node` and `npm run dev:dashboard`.

In the dashboard: press `/` to focus the KV console, `s` to toggle the
synthetic traffic simulator, `m` to toggle sound cues (off by default).

### Running a Local Cluster

Not available yet — multi-node support arrives with the Quarter II sprints.

## Usage

```bash
# Set a key
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key":"user:1","value":"Saatvik","ttl":300}'

# Get a key
curl http://localhost:8080/get/user:1

# Delete a key
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/delete/user:1
```

| GET    | `/version`     | Package name + version                   |

> Full API documentation available in [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md).

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit + API tests (core cache logic + REST routes via supertest)
npm test
```

CI also runs backend typecheck, `prettier --check`, the dashboard's
`oxlint`, the dashboard build, and a Docker build-and-run smoke test
against `/health` on every push/PR — see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full local pre-PR checklist.
Load/benchmark tooling (`npm run benchmark`) is planned for Quarter III.

## Deployment

The cache node and the dashboard are deployed separately — the node needs
a long-running process (in-memory store, TTL sweeper), the dashboard is a
static build.

**Node**, via the included `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker compose up --build
# or: docker build -t inkcache-node . && docker run -p 8080:8080 inkcache-node
```

Deploys to any host that runs a container off a Dockerfile — Render,
Railway, Fly.io, a VPS. **Not Vercel** for this half: Vercel's functions
are stateless/serverless, so the in-memory cache would be wiped between
invocations and the TTL sweeper couldn't run — that would defeat the
entire point of a cache.

**Dashboard**, as a static build (`npm --prefix src/dashboard run build`)
— this part deploys fine to Vercel (a `vercel.json` with SPA rewrites is
already in `src/dashboard/`). This repo is a monorepo — the root
`package.json` is the backend's, not a frontend project — so **set
Vercel's Project → Root Directory to `src/dashboard`**, otherwise Vercel
will try to build the wrong package.json and fail before it ever reads
`vercel.json`. Point it at a node running elsewhere by setting
`VITE_API_BASE` at build time (see
[`src/dashboard/.env.example`](src/dashboard/.env.example)), and add that
dashboard's origin to `INKCACHE_CORS_ORIGIN` on the node side (see
[docs/api.md](docs/api.md#eviction-policy) for the full env var table).
